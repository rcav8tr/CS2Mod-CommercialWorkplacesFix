# Commercial Workplaces Fix
Fix for commercial company workplaces never increasing.
For example, if your commercial company is stuck at 5/5 employees.

# Description
The game logic intends to add workplaces to commercial companies for example as the building levels up.
But a bug in the game logic prevents workplaces from being added to commercial companies.
This mod fixes the bug until the bug can be fixed in the game logic.

The new workplaces are not added all at once.
The logic periodically adds one workplace at a time to companies that meet all the conditions for adding a workplace.
It could take some time for all potential workplaces to be added to all your commercial companies.
You can use mods like **Building Use** or **InfoLoom** to monitor the changes in commercial workplaces.

## NOTICE
This mod may more than double the number of workplaces at commercial companies, especially in buildings that are already at a higher level.
Your city may need more workers to satisfy the increase in workplaces.


# Compatibility
There are no known compatibility issues with any other mods.

If this mod is disabled or unsubscribed, workplaces already added to existing commercial companies will remain initially.
Note that there is still game logic to remove workplaces if not enough resources are sold by a commercial company.
